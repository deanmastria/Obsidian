### 1. **`BetManager` Class:**

#### Functionality:

- **Purpose:** This class is responsible for handling the player's bets, including validating the input and ensuring the player has enough balance to place the bet.
- **Method:** `placeBet(Player player)` handles the entire betting process, prompting the user, validating the input, and deducting the balance.

#### Detailed Review:

- **Input Validation:**
    
    - You are using a `try-catch` block to handle invalid inputs, such as non-numeric entries, which is effective. The loop then asks for input again, ensuring that the game doesn’t crash due to invalid input.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** While you handle non-numeric inputs, you might want to add a maximum retry limit to avoid an infinite loop in case the user continues to enter invalid data.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** You could also provide the player with an option to quit directly from the betting process if they want to leave the game without making further bets.
- **Handling Bets:**
    
    - The loop checks if the bet is in increments of 5 and ensures that the player has enough funds to place the bet. If not, appropriate messages are printed.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** The condition checking for valid bets could be more concise. For example:
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `if (bet == 0 || bet % 5 == 0 && player.placeBet(bet)) {     break; } else {     System.out.println("Invalid bet. Try again."); }`
        
        This reduces the complexity of the condition and consolidates the error message.
- **Efficiency:**
    
    - The class is efficient in its current form for the given task. However, consider whether the `Scanner` object should be passed in from outside, as it tightly couples this class with the input method. You might want to refactor it to decouple input handling from the betting logic.

#### Potential Refactoring:

- **Separation of Concerns:** You could separate the validation logic into a helper method to improve readability:
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `private boolean isValidBet(int bet, Player player) {     if (bet == 0 || bet % 5 != 0 || !player.hasEnoughBalance(bet)) {         return false;     }     return true; }`
    

### 2. **`Card` Class:**

#### Functionality:

- **Purpose:** Represents a playing card with a suit and rank.
- **Methods:** The class has basic getter methods and a `toString` method to represent the card as a string.

#### Detailed Review:

- **Encapsulation:**
    
    - The class encapsulates the card details effectively, providing getter methods for accessing the suit and rank.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** Making the fields `final` would make the `Card` class immutable, which is a good practice for classes that represent value objects like playing cards.
- **toString Method:**
    
    - The overridden `toString` method provides a readable representation of the card, which is useful for displaying the card's details in the game.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** While this method is simple and effective, consider handling edge cases where the card’s suit or rank might be null (though this shouldn’t happen in normal gameplay).

#### Potential Refactoring:

- **Constructor Validation:** You might want to validate the suit and rank in the constructor to ensure that invalid cards aren’t created:
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `public Card(String cardSuit, String cardRank) {     if (!Arrays.asList("Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades").contains(cardSuit)) {         throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid suit");     }     if (!Arrays.asList("2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace").contains(cardRank)) {         throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid rank");     }     this.cardSuit = cardSuit;     this.cardRank = cardRank; }`
    

### 3. **`Dealer` Class:**

#### Functionality:

- **Purpose:** Inherits from `Player` and adds specific behavior for the dealer in a Blackjack game.
- **Methods:** The `shouldHit` method determines whether the dealer should take another card based on the current hand value.

#### Detailed Review:

- **Inheritance:**
    
    - The class correctly leverages inheritance from `Player`, reducing code duplication and allowing the dealer to use player methods like `receiveCard` and `calculateHandValue`.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** Since the dealer has specific rules, you could consider adding more dealer-specific logic here, such as automatically standing on certain hand values or handling edge cases.
- **shouldHit Method:**
    
    - The method follows standard Blackjack rules where the dealer hits if the hand value is below 17.
    - **No changes needed** here, as the logic is straightforward and effective.

#### Potential Refactoring:

- **Custom Logic:** If the game rules are extended, you might need to refactor this class to handle more complex dealer strategies or introduce different dealer behaviors (e.g., based on difficulty levels).

### 4. **`Deck` Class:**

#### Functionality:

- **Purpose:** Manages the deck of cards, including initialization, shuffling, and dealing cards.
- **Methods:** Includes methods to shuffle the deck, deal a card, and print the deck's contents.

#### Detailed Review:

- **Initialization:**
    
    - The constructor correctly initializes a standard deck of 52 cards.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** If you anticipate the need for multiple decks (e.g., in games like Blackjack), you could refactor the constructor to accept a parameter specifying the number of decks to include.
- **shuffle Method:**
    
    - The method uses `Collections.shuffle()` to randomize the order of the cards, which is efficient and standard.
    - **No changes needed** here.
- **dealCard Method:**
    
    - The method checks if the deck is empty and returns `null` if no cards are left.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** You might want to throw a custom exception instead of returning `null`, which would make error handling more explicit in the game logic.

#### Potential Refactoring:

- **Custom Exception Handling:** Consider adding a custom exception, such as `EmptyDeckException`, to handle cases where the deck is empty.
    
- **Interface Implementation:** If the `DeckActions` interface isn't necessary, consider simplifying the class by removing it, unless you plan to add more deck-related actions later.
    

### 5. **`GameRunner` Class:**

#### Functionality:

- **Purpose:** This is the main class that runs the game, handling the game flow, managing rounds, and interacting with the player.
- **Methods:** The `main` method and helper methods like `promptToPlayAgain` manage the overall game state and interaction.

#### Detailed Review:

- **Game Flow:**
    
    - The game loop is clearly structured, managing the different phases of the game (betting, dealing cards, checking for busts, determining the winner).
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** Extracting more of the game logic into helper methods could make the `main` method more concise and easier to read.
- **Method Extraction:**
    
    - The `main` method is quite large and could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused methods.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** For example, you could create methods for handling player turns, dealer turns, and checking for winners. This would improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

#### Potential Refactoring:

- **Helper Methods:** Consider extracting the logic for different phases of the game (e.g., betting, dealing, determining the winner) into separate methods:
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `private void handlePlayerTurn(Player player, Deck deck) {     // Logic for player's turn }  private void handleDealerTurn(Dealer dealer, Deck deck) {     // Logic for dealer's turn }  private void determineWinner(Player player, Dealer dealer) {     // Logic for determining the winner }`
    

### 6. **`Player` Class:**

#### Functionality:

- **Purpose:** Manages the player’s hand of cards, balance, and actions like betting and splitting hands.
- **Methods:** Includes methods to calculate hand values, check for busts, and manage the player's balance.

#### Detailed Review:

- **Hand Management:**
    
    - The class manages both the regular hand and the split hand effectively, providing methods to add cards, calculate hand values, and reset the hand.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** As the split hand logic becomes more complex, you might want to encapsulate this logic into a separate `Hand` class, which could handle both regular and split hands. This would reduce the complexity within the `Player` class.
- **Balance Handling:**
    
    - The methods for handling bets and updating the balance are simple and clear.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** Consider adding a method to check if the player has enough balance before attempting to place a bet. This would help avoid situations where the player tries to bet more than they have.

#### Potential Refactoring:

- **Hand Class:** Consider creating a `Hand` class to manage a collection of cards, calculate values, and check for busts. This would make the `Player` class more focused on the player’s attributes and actions.

### 7. **`PlayerActionManager` Class:**

#### Functionality:

- **Purpose:** Manages the player's actions during the game, including hitting, standing, and doubling down.
- **Methods:** The class includes methods for playing the hand, checking for splits, and handling different player actions.

#### Detailed Review:

- **Player Interaction:**
    
    - The logic for handling player actions (hit, stand, double down) is clear and concise. The method checks for valid inputs and updates the game state accordingly.
    - **Improvement Suggestion:** The `playHand` method is quite large and could benefit from being broken down into smaller methods for handling different actions (e.g., `handleHit`, `handleDoubleDown`).
- **Split Handling:**
    
    - The `checkSplit` method is well-implemented, allowing the player to split their hand if the conditions are met and managing the additional bet.
    - **No changes needed** here, as the logic is sound and works within the game rules.

#### Potential Refactoring:

- **Method Extraction:** Similar to the `GameRunner` class, breaking down the logic for different player actions into separate methods would improve readability and maintainability:
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `private boolean handleHit(Player player, boolean isSplitHand) {     // Logic for handling hit action }  private boolean handleDoubleDown(Player player, int bet, boolean isSplitHand) {     // Logic for handling double down action }`



------------------------------



## Bet Manager
Let's dive into the `BetManager` class in more detail. Below is the class code for reference:

```java
package org.example;

import java.util.InputMismatchException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BetManager {
    private final Scanner sc;

    public BetManager(Scanner sc) {
        this.sc = sc;
    }

    public int placeBet(Player player) {
        int bet = 0;
        while (true) {
            System.out.printf("Place Bet (increments of 5): ");
            try {
                bet = sc.nextInt();
            } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
                System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter a number.");
                sc.nextLine(); // Consume the invalid input
                continue;
            }
            sc.nextLine(); // Consume the newline

            if (bet == 0 || (bet % 5 == 0 && player.placeBet(bet))) {
                break;
            } else if (bet % 5 != 0) {
                System.out.println("Bet must be in increments of 5. Try again.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Not enough money to place bet. Try again or enter 0 to leave the table.");
            }
        }
        return bet;
    }
}
```

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **Class Responsibility:**
   - **Purpose:** The `BetManager` class is responsible for managing the betting process during the game. It ensures that the player places a valid bet and has sufficient balance.
   - **Functionality:** The main functionality is encapsulated within the `placeBet` method, which handles user input, validates the bet, and interacts with the player's balance.

#### 2. **Dependency Injection:**
   - **Scanner Object:** The class accepts a `Scanner` object in its constructor, which is used for reading user input. This is a common approach, but it does create a dependency on the console input method.
   - **Improvement Suggestion:** If you ever want to test this class or use a different input method (e.g., a graphical user interface), you might want to decouple the input logic from the betting logic. This could be achieved by passing a `BetInputProvider` interface, which can be implemented by different input sources.

   Example:
   ```java
   public interface BetInputProvider {
       int getNextBet();
   }

   public class ConsoleBetInputProvider implements BetInputProvider {
       private final Scanner sc;

       public ConsoleBetInputProvider(Scanner sc) {
           this.sc = sc;
       }

       @Override
       public int getNextBet() {
           return sc.nextInt();
       }
   }
   ```

#### 3. **Input Validation:**
   - **Try-Catch Block:** The use of a `try-catch` block to handle `InputMismatchException` ensures that the game does not crash due to invalid input (e.g., entering a string instead of a number). This is a good practice, especially in user-facing applications.
   - **Improvement Suggestion:** You might want to limit the number of retries to prevent an infinite loop if the user continues to provide invalid input. For example, you could add a counter that tracks the number of invalid attempts and breaks out of the loop after a certain number of retries.

   Example:
   ```java
   int retries = 0;
   while (retries < 3) {
       // Existing logic
       retries++;
   }
   if (retries >= 3) {
       System.out.println("Too many invalid attempts. Exiting...");
       break;
   }
   ```

#### 4. **Bet Validation:**
   - **Increments of 5:** The requirement that bets must be in increments of 5 is clearly enforced in the code. If the player does not enter a valid bet, the method prints an error message and prompts the player again.
   - **Sufficient Funds:** The method checks whether the player has enough funds to place the bet. If not, it informs the player and asks for a new bet.

   **Improvement Suggestion:** You could simplify the condition that checks the bet and balance to reduce complexity. For example, you might create a helper method to handle the validation logic.

   Example:
   ```java
   private boolean isValidBet(int bet, Player player) {
       return (bet % 5 == 0 && player.hasEnoughBalance(bet));
   }
   ```

   Then in the `placeBet` method:
   ```java
   if (bet == 0 || isValidBet(bet, player)) {
       break;
   }
   ```

#### 5. **Loop Control:**
   - **While Loop:** The `while (true)` loop is used to continuously prompt the player until a valid bet is placed or the player exits the game.
   - **Improvement Suggestion:** Although this is a valid approach, consider using a boolean flag to control the loop, which could make the loop condition more explicit:
   ```java
   boolean validBetPlaced = false;
   while (!validBetPlaced) {
       // Logic
       if (conditionMet) {
           validBetPlaced = true;
       }
   }
   ```

#### 6. **Method Return:**
   - The method returns the final valid bet after the player successfully places it. If the player chooses to exit, it returns `0`.

   **Improvement Suggestion:** If you add an option to quit the betting process, you could return a special value (like `-1`) to indicate that the player has chosen to exit, which would differentiate between exiting and placing a `0` bet.

### Summary:
The `BetManager` class is solid in its current form, with effective error handling and bet validation. However, there are opportunities for refactoring to improve readability and flexibility, such as decoupling the input method, simplifying validation logic, and controlling the loop with a boolean flag. Adding limits on retries and an option to quit the betting process would further enhance the user experience.

## Card
Next, let's take a detailed look at the **`Card`** class. Here’s the code for reference:

```java
package org.example;

public class Card {
    private String cardSuit; // Suit of card
    private String cardRank; // Rank of card

    // Constructor to initialize the card's suit and rank
    public Card(String cardSuit, String cardRank) {
        this.cardSuit = cardSuit;
        this.cardRank = cardRank;
    }

    // Getter method for retrieving card suit
    public String getCardSuit() {
        return cardSuit;
    }

    // Getter method for retrieving card rank
    public String getCardRank() {
        return cardRank;
    }

    // Overriding the toString method to provide a string representation of the card
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return cardRank + " of " + cardSuit;
    }
}
```

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **Class Responsibility:**
   - **Purpose:** The `Card` class represents a playing card with a suit (e.g., Clubs, Diamonds) and a rank (e.g., 2, King, Ace).
   - **Functionality:** It encapsulates the data for a card and provides methods to access the suit and rank. The class also provides a string representation of the card for display purposes.

#### 2. **Encapsulation:**
   - **Private Fields:** The `cardSuit` and `cardRank` fields are private, which is a good practice for encapsulation. This ensures that the card's properties can only be accessed and modified through the provided methods.
   - **Getter Methods:** The `getCardSuit` and `getCardRank` methods allow access to the card's properties while maintaining encapsulation.

   **Improvement Suggestion:** 
   - You might consider making the fields `final`, which would make the `Card` class immutable. An immutable object is generally easier to reason about and prevents accidental modification. This is particularly useful in games where card properties should not change once the card is created.

   Example:
   ```java
   private final String cardSuit;
   private final String cardRank;
   ```

#### 3. **Constructor:**
   - **Initialization:** The constructor initializes the `cardSuit` and `cardRank` fields with the provided values. This is straightforward and effective for creating a card instance.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Input Validation:** You might want to add validation in the constructor to ensure that only valid suits and ranks are allowed. This would prevent the creation of invalid cards and ensure that all cards in the game are legitimate.

   Example:
   ```java
   public Card(String cardSuit, String cardRank) {
       if (!Arrays.asList("Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades").contains(cardSuit)) {
           throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid suit");
       }
       if (!Arrays.asList("2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace").contains(cardRank)) {
           throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid rank");
       }
       this.cardSuit = cardSuit;
       this.cardRank = cardRank;
   }
   ```

   This ensures that only valid card suits and ranks can be used, which could prevent bugs or unexpected behavior in your game logic.

#### 4. **toString Method:**
   - **String Representation:** The overridden `toString` method provides a simple and effective string representation of the card, e.g., "Ace of Spades." This is helpful when displaying the card in the game.
   - **Improvement Suggestion:** While the method is effective as is, you might want to consider handling edge cases where the suit or rank could be `null`. Although this shouldn’t happen under normal circumstances, it's good practice to account for such possibilities.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Override
   public String toString() {
       if (cardRank == null || cardSuit == null) {
           return "Invalid Card";
       }
       return cardRank + " of " + cardSuit;
   }
   ```

#### 5. **Efficiency:**
   - **Lightweight Class:** The `Card` class is lightweight and efficient, as it only stores two strings representing the suit and rank. This is appropriate for a class that will likely have many instances during the game.

   **No major changes needed** in terms of efficiency.

#### 6. **Potential Future Enhancements:**
   - **Enum for Suits and Ranks:** If you want to enforce stricter typing and reduce the possibility of invalid suits or ranks, you could consider using `enum` types for `cardSuit` and `cardRank`. This would ensure that only predefined suits and ranks can be used.

   Example:
   ```java
   public enum Suit { CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES }
   public enum Rank { TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE }

   private final Suit suit;
   private final Rank rank;

   public Card(Suit suit, Rank rank) {
       this.suit = suit;
       this.rank = rank;
   }
   ```

   This approach provides compile-time safety and can make your code more robust.

### Summary:
The `Card` class is well-implemented and fulfills its role effectively. Adding immutability, validation in the constructor, and possibly considering the use of enums for suits and ranks could enhance the class's reliability and prevent potential errors.

## Dealer
Next, let’s dive into the **`Dealer`** class. Here’s the code for reference:

```java
package org.example;

public class Dealer extends Player {

    public Dealer() {
        super("Dealer", 0);
    }

    public boolean shouldHit() {
        return calculateHandValue() < 17;
    }
}
```

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **Class Responsibility:**
   - **Purpose:** The `Dealer` class represents the dealer in a Blackjack game. It inherits from the `Player` class, reusing much of the functionality designed for the player, but with dealer-specific behavior.
   - **Functionality:** The primary responsibility of the `Dealer` class is to follow the Blackjack rule that the dealer must hit (draw another card) until their hand value is 17 or higher. The class also inherits all the methods from the `Player` class.

#### 2. **Inheritance:**
   - **Usage of Inheritance:** The `Dealer` class extends the `Player` class, which is a good design choice since the dealer shares many similarities with a player (e.g., having a hand, receiving cards, calculating hand value).
   - **Constructor:** The `Dealer` constructor calls the `Player` constructor, initializing the dealer's name as "Dealer" and the balance as `0`. This is appropriate because the dealer doesn't have a balance to bet with, unlike the player.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - If you plan to extend the game to include multiple dealers or different types of dealers (e.g., an AI dealer with specific strategies), you might want to consider making `Dealer` an abstract class or creating more subclasses for different dealer behaviors.

#### 3. **shouldHit Method:**
   - **Purpose:** This method determines whether the dealer should take another card based on the Blackjack rule that the dealer must hit if their hand value is less than 17.
   - **Logic:** The method is straightforward, returning `true` if the hand value is less than 17 and `false` otherwise. This logic adheres to the standard rules of Blackjack.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - If you plan to add more complex rules or strategies for the dealer, you might want to abstract this method into a strategy pattern or add additional conditions. For example, you could have a `DealerStrategy` interface that different dealer behaviors implement, allowing you to change the dealer’s behavior dynamically.

   Example:
   ```java
   public interface DealerStrategy {
       boolean shouldHit(int handValue);
   }

   public class StandardDealerStrategy implements DealerStrategy {
       @Override
       public boolean shouldHit(int handValue) {
           return handValue < 17;
       }
   }
   ```

   Then in the `Dealer` class:
   ```java
   private DealerStrategy strategy;

   public Dealer(DealerStrategy strategy) {
       super("Dealer", 0);
       this.strategy = strategy;
   }

   public boolean shouldHit() {
       return strategy.shouldHit(calculateHandValue());
   }
   ```

#### 4. **Additional Dealer-Specific Behavior:**
   - **Dealer-Specific Actions:** The `Dealer` class currently only contains the `shouldHit` method. Depending on the game's rules, you may want to add other dealer-specific actions or overrides for methods inherited from `Player`.
   - **Hidden Card Logic:** One area where the dealer differs from the player in Blackjack is that one of the dealer’s cards is typically hidden until the player's turn is over. You might consider adding a method that handles the logic for revealing the dealer’s hidden card.

   Example:
   ```java
   public void revealHiddenCard() {
       // Logic to reveal the hidden card, if any
   }
   ```

#### 5. **Efficiency:**
   - **Lightweight Class:** The `Dealer` class is lightweight and efficient, as it reuses most of the functionality from the `Player` class while adding minimal dealer-specific logic. This is a good use of inheritance.

   **No major changes needed** in terms of efficiency.

#### 6. **Potential Future Enhancements:**
   - **AI Dealer:** If you plan to introduce AI behavior, you could expand the `Dealer` class with more complex decision-making algorithms, such as considering the player’s hand value or adding risk-taking strategies.
   - **Custom Dealer Rules:** If you want to vary the rules for the dealer (e.g., in different game modes), you could add parameters or methods that allow customization of the dealer’s behavior.

### Summary:
The `Dealer` class effectively leverages inheritance from the `Player` class, providing a clean and simple implementation of dealer-specific behavior in Blackjack. If you plan to expand the game with more complex dealer strategies or different types of dealers, you might consider refactoring the class to support those features. The class is well-structured and efficient as it stands.

## Deck
Next, let's examine the **`Deck`** class in detail. Here’s the code for reference:

```java
package org.example;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Deck implements DeckActions {
    private List<Card> cards;  // List to hold the cards in the deck

    // Loop through each suit and rank to create the full deck of cards
    public Deck() {
        cards = new ArrayList<>();
        String[] suits = {"Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"}; // Array of suits
        String[] ranks = {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"}; // Array of ranks

        // Add all cards to the deck
        for (String suit : suits) {
            for (String rank : ranks) {
                cards.add(new Card(suit, rank));  // Add a new card to the deck
            }
        }
    }

    // Method to shuffle the deck of cards
    public void shuffle() {
        Collections.shuffle(cards);
    }

    // Method to deal a card from the deck (removes and returns the top card)
    public Card dealCard() {
        if (cards.isEmpty()) {
            return null;    // Return null if the deck is empty (or throw an exception)
        }
        return cards.remove(cards.size() - 1);       // Remove and return the last card in the list
    }

    // Overriding the toString method to provide a string representation of the deck
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        StringBuilder deckString = new StringBuilder(); // Use StringBuilder for efficient string concatenation
        for (Card card : cards) {
            deckString.append(card.toString()).append("\n");    // Append each card to the string
        }
        return deckString.toString();
    }

    @Override
    public Card dealNextCard() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public void printDeck(int numToPrint) {
        // Implementation for printDeck method (not provided in the initial code)
    }
}
```

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **Class Responsibility:**
   - **Purpose:** The `Deck` class is responsible for managing a deck of cards, including initializing the deck, shuffling it, and dealing cards.
   - **Functionality:** The class provides methods for shuffling the deck, dealing a card, and printing the deck’s contents.

#### 2. **Initialization:**
   - **Deck Setup:** The constructor initializes the `cards` list and populates it with 52 cards (13 ranks for each of the 4 suits). This is standard for a single deck of cards.
   - **Array Usage:** The use of string arrays for `suits` and `ranks` is efficient and makes the code easy to understand.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Multiple Decks:** If you ever need to support multiple decks (e.g., in games like Blackjack with more than one deck), you might want to modify the constructor to accept a parameter that specifies the number of decks. This way, you can multiply the number of cards accordingly.

   Example:
   ```java
   public Deck(int numDecks) {
       cards = new ArrayList<>();
       for (int i = 0; i < numDecks; i++) {
           for (String suit : suits) {
               for (String rank : ranks) {
                   cards.add(new Card(suit, rank));
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   This change would make your deck class more versatile and suitable for different types of card games.

#### 3. **Shuffle Method:**
   - **Shuffling Logic:** The `shuffle` method uses `Collections.shuffle()` to randomize the order of the cards in the deck. This is a standard and efficient way to shuffle a list.

   **No changes needed** here, as this method is implemented effectively.

#### 4. **DealCard Method:**
   - **Dealing Cards:** The `dealCard` method removes and returns the top card from the deck (the last card in the list). If the deck is empty, it returns `null`.
   - **Empty Deck Handling:** Returning `null` when the deck is empty is one way to handle this situation, but you might want to consider throwing a custom exception instead. This would make it more explicit when the deck is empty, and the calling code can handle it accordingly.

   Example:
   ```java
   public Card dealCard() throws EmptyDeckException {
       if (cards.isEmpty()) {
           throw new EmptyDeckException("The deck is empty");
       }
       return cards.remove(cards.size() - 1);
   }
   ```

   Then you can create the `EmptyDeckException` class to handle this specific error.

#### 5. **toString Method:**
   - **String Representation:** The `toString` method iterates through the deck and builds a string representation of all the cards. This is useful for debugging or displaying the deck’s contents.
   - **Efficiency Consideration:** Using a `StringBuilder` is a good choice here, as it’s more efficient than concatenating strings in a loop.

   **No changes needed** here, as this method is both efficient and effective.

#### 6. **Interface Implementation:**
   - **DeckActions Interface:** The `Deck` class implements the `DeckActions` interface, which defines methods like `dealNextCard` and `printDeck`. However, these methods are currently unimplemented (e.g., `dealNextCard` returns `null`).
   - **Improvement Suggestion:** If you intend to use these methods in the future, you should implement them with the required functionality. Otherwise, consider removing them or modifying the interface to include only the methods that are relevant to your current use case.

   Example for `printDeck`:
   ```java
   @Override
   public void printDeck(int numToPrint) {
       for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(numToPrint, cards.size()); i++) {
           System.out.println(cards.get(i));
       }
   }
   ```

   Example for `dealNextCard`:
   ```java
   @Override
   public Card dealNextCard() {
       return dealCard();
   }
   ```

   This would align the class with the interface and make the methods functional.

#### 7. **Potential Future Enhancements:**
   - **Reshuffling:** If the deck runs out of cards, you might want to implement a method to reshuffle the used cards back into the deck. This is common in games like Blackjack, where the deck needs to be reused.
   - **Deck States:** You could also add methods to handle different states of the deck, such as resetting the deck, checking the number of cards remaining, or even dealing multiple cards at once.

### Summary:
The `Deck` class is well-designed and effectively handles the core functionalities of a deck of cards. Adding enhancements like support for multiple decks, better handling of an empty deck, and implementing the `DeckActions` interface methods would make the class more versatile and robust. It’s a solid implementation, and these suggestions could make it even better.

## GameRunner
Next, let's explore the **`GameRunner`** class in detail. Here’s the code for reference:

```java
package org.example;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class GameRunner {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        deck.shuffle();

        // Prompt the user for their name
        System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
        String playerName = sc.nextLine();

        // Create Player and Dealer
        Player player = new Player(playerName, 1000); // Player starts with a balance of 1000
        Dealer dealer = new Dealer();

        // Create managers
        BetManager betManager = new BetManager(sc);
        PlayerActionManager actionManager = new PlayerActionManager(sc, deck);

        while (true) {
            // Start new round
            player.resetHand();
            dealer.resetHand();
            deck.shuffle();

            System.out.println("Balance: " + player.getBalance());

            int bet = betManager.placeBet(player);
            if (bet == 0) {
                System.out.println(player.getName() + " has left the table. Remaining funds: " + player.getBalance());
                System.out.println("See you next time!");
                break;
            }

            dealer.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
            dealer.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());

            // Show the player's hand
            player.showHand();
            System.out.printf(player.getName() + " has " + player.calculateHandValue());
            System.out.printf("\nDealer shows " + dealer.getHand().get(0));

            // Check if player can split
            actionManager.checkSplit(player, bet);

            // Player's turn for first hand
            boolean playerBust = actionManager.playHand(player, bet, false);

            if (playerBust) {
                promptToPlayAgain(sc, player);
                continue; // Player busts, move to the next round
            }

            // Player's turn for split hand (if any)
            if (player.getSplitHand() != null) {
                System.out.println("Playing split hand:");
                playerBust = actionManager.playHand(player, bet, true);
                if (playerBust) {
                    promptToPlayAgain(sc, player);
                    continue; // Split hand busts, move to the next round
                }
            }

            // Dealer's turn
            dealer.showHand();
            System.out.println("Dealer's hand value: " + dealer.calculateHandValue());

            while (dealer.shouldHit()) {
                dealer.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
                dealer.showHand();
                System.out.println("Dealer's hand value: " + dealer.calculateHandValue());

                if (dealer.isBust()) {
                    System.out.println("Dealer busts! " + player.getName() + " wins.");
                    player.updateBalance(bet * 2); // Player wins, double the bet
                    promptToPlayAgain(sc, player);
                    continue; // Move to the next round
                }
            }

            // Determine the winner for first hand
            int playerValue = player.calculateHandValue();
            int dealerValue = dealer.calculateHandValue();

            System.out.println(player.getName() + "'s final hand value: " + playerValue);
            System.out.println("Dealer's final hand value: " + dealerValue);

            if (playerValue > dealerValue) {
                System.out.println(player.getName() + " wins!");
                player.updateBalance(bet * 2); // Player wins, double the bet
            } else if (playerValue < dealerValue) {
                System.out.println("Dealer wins!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("It's a tie!");
                player.updateBalance(bet); // Return the bet to player
            }

            // Determine the winner for split hand (if any)
            if (player.getSplitHand() != null) {
                int splitHandValue = player.calculateSplitHandValue();
                System.out.println(player.getName() + "'s split hand final value: " + splitHandValue);

                if (splitHandValue > dealerValue && !player.isSplitHandBust()) {
                    System.out.println(player.getName() + " wins with the split hand!");
                    player.updateBalance(bet * 2); // Player wins, double the bet
                } else if (splitHandValue < dealerValue || player.isSplitHandBust()) {
                    System.out.println("Dealer wins against the split hand!");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("It's a tie with the split hand!");
                    player.updateBalance(bet); // Return the bet to player
                }
            }

            System.out.println("Current Balance: " + player.getBalance());

            if (player.getBalance() <= 0) {
                System.out.println("You are out of funds, insert $$$ to play");
                break;
            }

            promptToPlayAgain(sc, player);
        }
    }

    private static void promptToPlayAgain(Scanner sc, Player player) {
        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Do you want to play another round? (y/n)");
            String anotherRound = sc.nextLine();
            if (anotherRound.equalsIgnoreCase("y")) {
                break;
            } else if (anotherRound.equalsIgnoreCase("n")) {
                System.out.println("Thanks for playing!");
                System.exit(0); // Exit the program
            } else {
                System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter 'y' or 'n'.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **Class Responsibility:**
   - **Purpose:** The `GameRunner` class serves as the entry point for the game, orchestrating the game flow, managing rounds, and interacting with the player and dealer.
   - **Functionality:** This class handles player inputs, manages the deck, and controls the game loop, including betting, dealing cards, and determining the winner.

#### 2. **Game Flow Management:**
   - **Game Loop:** The main game loop is implemented within the `while (true)` structure, ensuring continuous play until the player decides to leave the table or runs out of funds.
   - **Round Start:** Each round begins by resetting the player and dealer hands and shuffling the deck, which is a clean and straightforward approach to resetting the game state.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Break Down the Game Loop:** The `main` method is quite large, and breaking it down into smaller methods would improve readability and maintainability. For example, you could extract methods for:
     - **Resetting the game state:** A method that handles resetting the player and dealer hands and shuffling the deck.
     - **Dealing the initial hands:** A method to handle dealing the initial two cards to the player and dealer.
     - **Handling player actions:** A method for managing the player's turn.
     - **Handling the dealer's turn:** A method for the dealer's logic.

   Example:
   ```java
   private static void resetGame(Deck deck, Player player, Dealer dealer) {
       player.resetHand();
       dealer.resetHand();
       deck.shuffle();
   }
   
   private static void dealInitialHands(Deck deck, Player player, Dealer dealer) {
       player.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
       player.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
       dealer.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
       dealer.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
   }
   ```

   Breaking down the `main` method into smaller methods like this would make the logic easier to follow and maintain.

#### 3. **Player and Dealer Interaction:**
   - **Player Actions:** The code handles player actions, including betting, splitting, and playing their hand. The interaction with the `PlayerActionManager` class is clear and encapsulates the player’s actions effectively.
   - **Dealer’s Turn:** The dealer's turn is managed with a `while (dealer.shouldHit())` loop, which is a clean way to follow the rules of Blackjack where the dealer must hit until they reach 17.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Separation of Concerns:** You could separate the logic for the player’s turn and the dealer’s turn into different methods to make the code more modular. This would also allow you to easily modify the logic for each turn if needed.

   Example:
   ```java
   private static void handlePlayerTurn(Player player, Deck deck, PlayerActionManager actionManager, int bet) {
       boolean playerBust = actionManager.playHand(player, bet, false);
       if (playerBust) return;

       if (player.getSplitHand() != null) {
           System.out.println("Playing split hand:");
           playerBust = actionManager.playHand(player, bet, true);
       }
   }

   private static void handleDealerTurn(Dealer dealer, Deck deck) {
       while (dealer.shouldHit()) {
           dealer.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
           dealer.showHand();
           System.out.println("Dealer's hand value: " + dealer.calculateHandValue());
       }
   }
   ```

#### 4. **Betting and Balance Management:**
   - **Bet Placement:** The code effectively manages the player’s betting and updates the balance based on the outcome of each round. This is handled through interaction with the `BetManager` class, which encapsulates the betting logic.
   - **Balance Check:** The code checks whether the player has enough funds to continue playing, which is essential for managing the game flow.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Simplify Balance Update Logic:** The balance update logic is currently spread across multiple parts of the `main` method. You might want to consolidate this into a single method that updates

 the player’s balance based on the round’s outcome.

   Example:
   ```java
   private static void updatePlayerBalance(Player player, int bet, boolean playerWins) {
       if (playerWins) {
           player.updateBalance(bet * 2);
       } else {
           // Handle other cases, such as ties
       }
   }
   ```

#### 5. **Handling Split Hands:**
   - **Split Hand Logic:** The code manages split hands effectively, checking if the player can split and handling the split hand’s play separately. This is a key feature in Blackjack, and the implementation here is solid.
   - **Improvement Suggestion:** You could abstract the split hand logic into a separate method to further reduce complexity in the `main` method.

   Example:
   ```java
   private static void handleSplitHand(Player player, Dealer dealer, Deck deck, PlayerActionManager actionManager, int bet) {
       if (player.getSplitHand() != null) {
           System.out.println("Playing split hand:");
           boolean playerBust = actionManager.playHand(player, bet, true);
           if (playerBust) return;

           // Handle split hand outcome
       }
   }
   ```

#### 6. **User Interaction:**
   - **Prompting for Another Round:** The `promptToPlayAgain` method handles the user interaction for continuing the game or exiting. This is a clean implementation that allows the user to control the game flow.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Additional Options:** You could extend this method to offer additional options, such as viewing game statistics or resetting the game entirely.

   Example:
   ```java
   private static void promptToPlayAgain(Scanner sc, Player player) {
       while (true) {
           System.out.println("Do you want to play another round? (y/n) or view stats (s)");
           String choice = sc.nextLine();
           if (choice.equalsIgnoreCase("y")) {
               break;
           } else if (choice.equalsIgnoreCase("n")) {
               System.out.println("Thanks for playing!");
               System.exit(0);
           } else if (choice.equalsIgnoreCase("s")) {
               // Show game stats
           } else {
               System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter 'y', 'n', or 's'.");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

#### 7. **Efficiency:**
   - **Performance Considerations:** The `GameRunner` class is efficient in its current form, with minimal overhead. However, as the game logic grows, consider breaking down the methods into smaller units for easier maintenance and scalability.

   **No major changes needed** in terms of efficiency, but the improvements suggested above would help manage complexity.

### Summary:
The `GameRunner` class serves as the core of your game, effectively managing the game flow and player interaction. Breaking down the large `main` method into smaller, more focused methods would improve readability and make the code easier to maintain. Adding flexibility to the user interaction and refining the balance management logic could also enhance the overall gameplay experience.

## Player
Next, let’s dive into the **`Player`** class. Here’s the code for reference:

    }

    // Method for the player to receive a card

        System.out.println(name + " has " + hand.size() + " cards"); // Print the player's name and number of cards
        for (Card card : hand) {

                aceCount++;
            } else {

            }
        }

        // Adjust for Aces if value is over 21
        while (value > 21 && aceCount > 0) {
            value -= 10;
            aceCount--;
        }

        return value;
    }

    // Method to check if the player is bust

        return calculateSplitHandValue() > 21;
    }

    // Method to check if the player can split
    public boolean canSplit() {
        if (hand.size() == 2) {
            return hand.get(0).getCardRank().equals(hand.get(1).getCardRank());

    }

    // Method to update balance based on results
    public void updateBalance(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    // Getter method to retrieve the player's balance
    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Method to reset the player's hand
    public void resetHand() {
        hand.clear();
        splitHand = null;
    }
}
```

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **Class Responsibility:**
   - **Purpose:** The `Player` class manages the player's hand, split hand, balance, and related actions in the game.
   - **Functionality:** This class includes methods for receiving cards, calculating hand values, placing bets, checking for busts, and handling splits.

#### 2. **Hand Management:**
   - **Primary Hand:** The `hand` list holds the player's main hand of cards. The `receiveCard` method allows the player to receive cards during the game.
   - **Split Hand:** The `splitHand` list manages the player's split hand. The `receiveCardToSplitHand` method handles receiving cards for the split hand.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Encapsulate Hand Logic:** As the game logic becomes more complex, you might consider encapsulating the hand logic into a separate `Hand` class. This class could handle both the main and split hands, simplifying the `Player` class and improving readability.

   Example:
   ```java
   public class Hand {
       private List<Card> cards;
       // Methods for managing the hand, such as adding cards, calculating value, checking for busts, etc.
   }
   ```

   This change would allow the `Player` class to focus more on player-specific actions like betting and leave the card management to the `Hand` class.

#### 3. **Hand Value Calculation:**
   - **calculateHandValue Method:** The method correctly calculates the hand value, accounting for the special behavior of Aces (valued at either 1 or 11). The logic adjusts the value if the total exceeds 21.
   - **calculateSplitHandValue Method:** This method handles the value calculation for the split hand and reuses the `calculateHandValue` method.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Combine Logic:** You could refactor the hand value calculation into a single method that works for both the main hand and the split hand, reducing code duplication. If you implement a `Hand` class, this method could be part of that class.

#### 4. **Bust and Split Logic:**
   - **Bust Check:** The `isBust` and `isSplitHandBust` methods determine if the player has exceeded 21 in either their main hand or split hand.
   - **Split Check:** The `canSplit` method checks whether the player’s two cards have the same rank, allowing for a split.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Refactor Bust Logic:** Similar to hand value calculation, you could combine the bust check logic into a method that works for both the main hand and the split hand.

   Example:
   ```java
   public boolean isBust(Hand hand) {
       return hand.calculateValue() > 21;
   }
   ```

   This approach could also be part of a `Hand` class, further simplifying the `Player` class.

#### 5. **Betting and Balance Management:**
   - **Placing Bets:** The `placeBet` method checks if the player has enough balance to place a bet and deducts the bet amount from the balance.
   - **Updating Balance:** The `updateBalance` method adjusts the player's balance based on the result of the game.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Enhance Validation:** You could add more validation in the `placeBet` method, such as checking for negative bet amounts or ensuring that the bet is within certain limits.

   Example:
   ```java
   public boolean placeBet(int bet) {
       if (bet <= 0 || bet > balance) {
           System.out.println("Invalid bet amount");
           return false;
       }
       balance -= bet;
       return true;
   }
   ```

#### 6. **Displaying the Hand:**
   - **showHand and showSplitHand Methods:** These methods print the player's cards to the console, providing a simple way to display the hand.
   
   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Generalize Hand Display:** You could generalize these methods to work for both the main hand and split hand, reducing code duplication. If you implement a `Hand` class, this could be a method within that class.

   Example:
   ```java
   public void showHand(Hand hand) {
       System.out.println(name + " has " + hand.size() + " cards");
       for (Card card : hand.getCards()) {
           System.out.println(card);
       }
   }
   ```

#### 7. **Efficiency:**
   - **Handling Null Split Hands:** The code effectively checks for `null` split hands, ensuring that the split hand logic only runs when necessary. This prevents unnecessary operations and keeps the game logic efficient.

   **No major changes needed** in terms of efficiency, though the suggested refactoring could streamline the code further.

#### 8. **Potential Future Enhancements:**
   - **Player Statistics:** You could add methods to track and

 display player statistics, such as the number of wins, losses, and ties. This would enhance the gameplay experience by providing more feedback to the player.
   - **Handling Multiple Hands:** If you plan to support more complex scenarios (e.g., multiple splits), you might need to extend the logic to handle multiple hands beyond just the main hand and split hand.

### Summary:
The `Player` class effectively manages the player's hand, split hand, and balance. By refactoring some of the logic into a `Hand` class and generalizing methods to reduce duplication, you could simplify the code and improve readability. The class is well-implemented, and these suggestions could make it more modular and easier to maintain.

## PlayerActionManager
Next, let's explore the **`PlayerActionManager`** class in detail. Here’s the code for reference:

```java
package org.example;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class PlayerActionManager {
    private final Scanner sc;
    private final Deck deck;

    public PlayerActionManager(Scanner sc, Deck deck) {
        this.sc = sc;
        this.deck = deck;
    }

    public boolean playHand(Player player, int bet, boolean isSplitHand) {
        boolean playerDoubleDown = false;
        while (true) {
            System.out.println("\nHit, Stand, or Double Down? (h/s/d)");
            String input = sc.nextLine();

            if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("d")) {
                if (player.placeBet(bet)) {
                    bet *= 2;
                    playerDoubleDown = true;
                    System.out.println("Bet doubled. New bet: " + bet);
                    if (isSplitHand) {
                        player.receiveCardToSplitHand(deck.dealCard());
                        player.showSplitHand();
                        System.out.println("Player's split hand value: " + player.calculateSplitHandValue());
                    } else {
                        player.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
                        player.showHand();
                        System.out.println("Player's hand value: " + player.calculateHandValue());
                    }
                    break;
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Not enough balance to double down.");
                }
            } else if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("h")) {
                if (isSplitHand) {
                    player.receiveCardToSplitHand(deck.dealCard());
                    player.showSplitHand();
                    System.out.println("Player's split hand value: " + player.calculateSplitHandValue());
                } else {
                    player.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
                    player.showHand();
                    System.out.println("Player's hand value: " + player.calculateHandValue());
                }

                if ((isSplitHand && player.isSplitHandBust()) || (!isSplitHand && player.isBust())) {
                    System.out.println("Bust! Dealer wins.");
                    return true; // Indicate that the player has busted
                }
            } else if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("s")) {
                break;
            } else {
                System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter 'h' to hit, 's' to stand, or 'd' to double down.");
            }

            if (playerDoubleDown) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return false; // Indicate that the player has not busted
    }

    public void checkSplit(Player player, int bet) {
        if (player.canSplit()) {
            System.out.println("\nDo you want to split your hand? (y/n)");
            String splitInput = sc.nextLine();
            if (splitInput.equalsIgnoreCase("y")) {
                if (player.placeBet(bet)) {
                    player.receiveCardToSplitHand(player.getHand().remove(1));
                    player.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
                    player.receiveCardToSplitHand(deck.dealCard());
                    System.out.println("Hand split into two hands.");
                    player.showHand();
                    player.showSplitHand();
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Not enough balance to split.");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **Class Responsibility:**
   - **Purpose:** The `PlayerActionManager` class manages the player’s actions during the game, including hitting, standing, doubling down, and splitting hands.
   - **Functionality:** It provides methods for playing the hand (`playHand`) and checking if the player can split their hand (`checkSplit`).

#### 2. **Handling Player Actions:**
   - **playHand Method:** This method handles the main player actions: hit, stand, and double down. The method takes into account whether the player is playing with their main hand or split hand and updates the hand and bet accordingly.
   - **Action Input:** The method prompts the player for input and handles the various actions (`h` for hit, `s` for stand, and `d` for double down).

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Break Down the Method:** The `playHand` method is relatively large and handles multiple responsibilities. You could break it down into smaller methods to improve readability and maintainability. For example, you could create separate methods for handling the hit action, double down action, and input validation.

   Example:
   ```java
   private void handleHit(Player player, boolean isSplitHand) {
       if (isSplitHand) {
           player.receiveCardToSplitHand(deck.dealCard());
           player.showSplitHand();
           System.out.println("Player's split hand value: " + player.calculateSplitHandValue());
       } else {
           player.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
           player.showHand();
           System.out.println("Player's hand value: " + player.calculateHandValue());
       }
   }

   private void handleDoubleDown(Player player, int bet, boolean isSplitHand) {
       if (player.placeBet(bet)) {
           bet *= 2;
           System.out.println("Bet doubled. New bet: " + bet);
           handleHit(player, isSplitHand);
       } else {
           System.out.println("Not enough balance to double down.");
       }
   }
   ```

   By breaking down the logic into smaller methods, you make the code more modular and easier to maintain.

#### 3. **Double Down Logic:**
   - **Double Down Handling:** The `playHand` method handles the logic for doubling down, where the player places an additional bet equal to their original bet and receives only one more card. The logic is straightforward and correctly manages the player's balance and hand.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Simplify the Logic:** You could simplify the double down logic by extracting it into a helper method, as shown above. This would keep the `playHand` method more focused on the overall action flow.

#### 4. **Hit and Stand Logic:**
   - **Hit Handling:** The method handles the hit action by dealing a card to the player and updating the hand value. It also checks if the player has busted after each hit.
   - **Stand Handling:** The method allows the player to stand, which ends their turn.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Input Validation:** You might want to refactor the input validation logic into a helper method to keep the main flow of the `playHand` method cleaner.

   Example:
   ```java
   private boolean isValidInput(String input) {
       return input.equalsIgnoreCase("h") || input.equalsIgnoreCase("s") || input.equalsIgnoreCase("d");
   }
   ```

   Then use this method in `playHand` to check the player's input.

#### 5. **Split Hand Logic:**
   - **checkSplit Method:** This method checks if the player can split their hand and handles the splitting process if the player chooses to do so. The logic for splitting the hand is sound, and the method correctly manages the player's balance and hands.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Refactor Split Logic:** You could break down the split logic into smaller methods, making the `checkSplit` method more focused on checking whether the player can split and delegating the actual splitting process to another method.

   Example:
   ```java
   private void performSplit(Player player, int bet) {
       player.receiveCardToSplitHand(player.getHand().remove(1));
       player.receiveCard(deck.dealCard());
       player.receiveCardToSplitHand(deck.dealCard());
       System.out.println("Hand split into two hands.");
       player.showHand();
       player.showSplitHand();
   }
   ```

   This makes the `checkSplit` method more concise.

#### 6. **Efficiency:**
   - **Handling Player Choices:** The method efficiently handles player choices and updates the game state accordingly. The use of boolean flags (e.g., `playerDoubleDown`) helps manage the flow of the game and ensure that actions are processed correctly.

   **No major changes needed** in terms of efficiency, though the suggested refactoring could streamline the code and make it easier to manage.

#### 7. **User Interaction:**
   - **Prompts and Feedback:** The class provides clear prompts and feedback to the player, which enhances the user experience. The method prints messages based on the player's actions and the game state, making it easy for the player to understand what's happening.

   **Improvement Suggestion:**
   - **Error Handling:** You might want to enhance error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios (e.g., handling cases where the deck runs out of cards).

#### 8. **Potential Future Enhancements:**
   - **Custom Action Logic:** If you plan to add more complexity to the game (e.g., additional actions or special rules), you might want to expand the `PlayerActionManager` class to handle these new features. You could add more methods for specific actions or even introduce a strategy pattern for different player behaviors.
   - **AI Player Actions:** If you plan to introduce AI players, you could extend this class to handle AI decision-making, either by adding AI-specific logic or by creating a separate manager for AI actions.

### Summary:
The `PlayerActionManager` class effectively manages the player's actions during the game. By breaking down the larger methods into smaller, more focused methods, you can improve readability and maintainability. The class is well-implemented, and these suggestions could make it more modular and easier to extend in the future.
