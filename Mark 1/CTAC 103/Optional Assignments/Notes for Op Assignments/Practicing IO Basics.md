# Assignment Details

### Objective:

To test your understanding of Java I/O classes and concepts.

### Instructions:

This assignment contains a series of tasks and questions related to Java I/O. Implement your code solutions in Java, and write your answers in complete sentences where necessary.

#### Tasks:

1. Write a simple Java program that uses FileInputStream to read a file byte by byte. The file should be a .txt file of your choosing that contains several lines of text. Output the read data to the console.
    
2. Write a Java program that uses FileOutputStream to write data to a .txt file. The data should be a string of your choosing. Verify the result by opening the file and checking its contents.
    
3. Modify the programs you wrote in tasks 1 and 2 to use BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream, respectively. Compare the performance of these versions with the original versions. Explain your observations.
    
4. Create a Java program that uses InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter. The program should read from a .txt file using InputStreamReader, convert the read data into uppercase, and then write the uppercase data to another .txt file using OutputStreamWriter.
    
5. Write a Java program that uses FileReader and FileWriter to read a .txt file and write its content to another .txt file in reverse order (i.e., the input file's last line becomes the output file's first line).
    
6. Write a Java program that uses DataInputStream and DataOutputStream to write primitive data types to a file and then read them back. The data types should include: int, float, boolean, and char.
    
7. Implement a simple object serialization and deserialization using ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream. Define a class with some attributes, create an instance of the class, serialize the object to a file, then read the file and deserialize the object.
    

#### Questions:

1. What is I/O in the context of Java? Provide some common use cases for I/O in Java.
    
2. What are InputStream and OutputStream in Java, and what are their primary purposes?
    
3. What are the benefits of using buffered I/O streams in Java?
    
4. What is the purpose of InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter in Java, and when should they be used?
    
5. Describe the difference between FileInputStream and FileReader, and between FileOutputStream and FileWriter.
    
6. What are BufferedReader and BufferedWriter used for in Java?
    
7. What are DataInputStream and DataOutputStream, and what unique functionality do they provide?
    
8. Explain the concept of object serialization in Java. Why is it important, and in what scenarios might it be used?
